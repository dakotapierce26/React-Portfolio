                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>My name is Dakota Pierce and this is a little information on my background. In 2013, I graduated from Riverdale High School, located in Murfreesboro, TN, after achieving the title of National Art Honor Society President. After high school I joined the work force and did a multitude of different jobs from a cashier in the beginning to driving a tractor-trailer. I also stayed with a company for six years working from a machine operator to a lead quality technician position. However these things didn't satisfy my passion for computers and the pursuit of understanding them. That was when I decided that I would become a web developer and learn coding to pursue my interests.</p>
